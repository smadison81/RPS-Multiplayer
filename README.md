<h1>Rock Paper Scissors True Mutiplayer</h1>

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game with a twist.  This game can be played by 2 players anywhere in the world.  Using Firebase, the game will log the first two players connected to the webpage as player 1 and player 2 and set them up to play each other.  Any other connections after the first two are removed from the game and told the lobby is full. 

Players take turns picking their selection, and then the game evaluates who wins.
